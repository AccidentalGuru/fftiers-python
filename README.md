This code has only been tested on Mac OS X.

The code is meant to be run interactively in R, mostly because K (the number of tiers / clusters) must be specified ahead of time. Picking K is where trial / error / experience is handy.

Note: the USEOLD flag has been depricated and not maintained in favor of chart readability.  Examples of how the USEOLD charts looked can be found here: http://www.borischen.co/2013/09/visualized-tiers-and-ranks-week-2-91113.html

TODO:
- Export to spreadsheet
- Half PPR charts
- 6PaTD model?
- Find a clustering package that does not require K as input.
