1,David Johnson ARI ,8,1,2,1.3,0.4,1.0,0.0,When you see a 25-year-old running back getting 25.8 combined carries/targets, it's a given to put him as a clear-cut top player, especially when it's a player as talented as Johnson. His goal for this next season is set at 1,000 rushing and receiving yards, and it's well within the realm of possibilities.
2,Le'Veon Bell PIT ,9,1,2,1.7,0.4,2.0,0.0,If Bell can stay on the field for all 16 games, it's quite possible that we see him break records. He's still yet to have a game in his NFL career with fewer than 7.8 PPR points. There's actually been just three of his 47 games with fewer than 10.9 PPR points.
3,LeSean McCoy BUF ,6,3,7,3.6,0.9,4.0,+1.0,McCoy and the Bills running backs enjoyed a massive 2.56 yards before contact in 2016, which was 0.29 yards more than the next highest team. With Mike Gillislee now in New England, McCoy should keep his high workload, even with a new coaching staff in tow, as well as get a bit more goal-line work.
4,Melvin Gordon LAC ,9,3,11,4.8,1.3,5.0,+1.0,Despite averaging a mediocre 4.0 yards per carry heading into his Week 14 matchup where he hurt his knee, Gordon was sitting as the No. 3 fantasy running back. The Chargers have one of the most difficult passing schedules in the league, but also have receivers to pull defenders out of the box. Gordon should build on his 2016 season.
5,Devonta Freeman ATL ,5,3,12,5.8,1.5,6.0,+1.0,Freeman says he wants to be the highest-paid running back in the NFL, and he's got the chance in a contract year. Despite ranking 13th in carries last year, Freeman totaled the sixth-most fantasy points among running backs. After struggling a bit out of the gate, Freeman went on to score eight touchdowns in the final six regular season games. With Kyle Shanahan gone, the Falcons may go back to more of a one-back system.
6,Jay Ajayi MIA ,11,3,11,6.8,1.6,9.0,+3.0,We mustn't forget that Ajayi wasn't even starting ahead of Arian Foster to start 2016 and was so mad about it that he didn't get to participate in Week 1. He played out of his mind for a few weeks, but against any defense that wasn't in the bottom-eight, he struggled. Some offensive line issues contributed to that, but expectations should be tempered, as there are also injury concerns.
7,Jordan Howard CHI ,9,4,13,7.2,1.8,8.0,+1.0,There is concern over his lack of usage in the passing game, as the Bears signed free agent Benny Cunningham and drafted Tarik Cohen, who are both pass-game specialists. He finished second in the NFL in rushing yards, so you have to give him the benefit of the doubt, but there is some risk.
8,DeMarco Murray TEN ,8,4,13,7.7,1.8,7.0,-1.0,It was clear that Murray wore down as the season went on, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry over the final six weeks, after averaging 4.87 over the first 10 weeks. There was just one game all season in which he didn't touch the ball at least 16 times, so he should still be a low-end RB1 by default.
9,Leonard Fournette JAC ,8,6,25,10.5,2.6,11.0,+2.0,You don't draft a running back with the No. 4 overall pick and not play him. Fournette is a special player and even though he isn't a great receiver, the work will be there for him. I recently did a study on coaching changes and the effect they have on pass/run games. Everything is going in Fournette's favor.
10,Todd Gurley LAR ,8,5,17,10.5,2.2,10.0,0.0,Call this as me buying into new head coach Sean McVay's offense, as he's said numerous times that his goal is to make Gurley as good as he can be. They added one of the best left tackles in the game this off-season with Andrew Whitworth, which definitely doesn't hurt. He's not the player you thought he was, but he's going to get 300-plus carries.
11,Ezekiel Elliott DAL ,6,3,32,10.9,6.6,3.0,-8.0,Zeke is suspended for six games, which may drop to 3 or 4 after appeal. Even if he misses the full time, he could still finish as a top 10 fantasy player. If you prorate his VBD to just 10 games last season, he still would have finished #7 overall and ahead of Devonta Freeman.
12,Lamar Miller HOU ,7,7,23,12.5,2.9,13.0,+1.0,Despite getting all the work he possibly could last year, Miller disappointed finishing with the sixth-most carries, but just the 17th most fantasy points among running backs. He misses two games, but the workload was there. The Texans spent a third-round pick to acquire D'Onta Foreman, which adds concern to that workload hanging around.
13,Isaiah Crowell CLE ,9,5,22,12.9,2.6,15.0,+2.0,What do you get when you mix an average running back with a great offensive line? An RB2, that's Crowell in a nutshell. Most point to his yards per carry (4.8) being great last year, but he totaled 48 percent of his rushing yards on just 16 carries. Their offensive line may just be the best in the NFL at this point, making him an intriguing option.
14,Marshawn Lynch OAK ,10,8,36,15.8,5.1,12.0,-2.0,I understand the want to love Lynch in Oakland â€"" great running back behind a great offensive line, and the plodding Latavius Murray scored 12 touchdowns last year, so why can't the bruising Lynch. He's been out of football for a year and a half, not rehabbing an injury, but building homes in Haiti. He's 31-years-old, so keep expectations realistic.
15,Carlos Hyde SF ,11,11,24,16.1,3.1,17.0,+2.0,Don't buy the Joe Williams hype, even if he was hand-picked by the new regime. So was Tevin Coleman, but Devonta Freeman was the better player who got the bulk of the work. Hyde has broken 75 tackles over the last two years on just 370 touches and is one of the most elusive backs in the game. His 3.1 yards after contact last year ranked fifth among running backs with at least 100 carries.
16,Joe Mixon CIN ,6,9,47,18.3,5.8,16.0,0.0,If we get clarity on Mixon being the starter and workhorse out of the gate, he's going to move up on this list. His talent wasn't ever the question, and if Gio Bernard isn't completely healthy by the start of the season, Mixon could provide RB1 value.
17,Ty Montgomery GB ,8,8,54,18.8,6.2,19.0,+2.0,Despite them drafting two running backs, Montgomery likely isn't going anywhere. He offers something in the passing game both Jamaal Williams and Aaron Jones don't, wide receiver skills. His 5.1 yards after contact was the best in the NFL last year, though the sample size was small.
18,Christian McCaffrey CAR ,11,12,42,20.5,5.9,14.0,-4.0,I have my questions about McCaffrey, but when a team spends a top-10 pick on a running back, they're going to use him. He's worth more in PPR formats considering his receiving abilities, but you're also relying on Cam Newton to start throwing to running backs. There's risk here, but there's also upside.
19,Dalvin Cook MIN ,9,11,40,20.9,5.8,21.0,+2.0,When the Vikings signed Latavius Murray, most thought they were likely done addressing the position. But once they signed him, he had foot surgery, leading the Vikings to trade up and draft Cook. Playing behind one of the worst offensive lines in football will be tough for anyone, but look for them to give Cook every opportunity to win the starting job, and I suspect he will.
20,C.J. Anderson DEN ,5,13,42,21.7,5.3,20.0,0.0,Anderson has averaged a massive 4.56 yards per carry in his career, while those around him over the last couple of years have totaled a measly 3.90 yards per carry with the team. The Broncos beefed up their offensive line this off-season via free agency (Former Cowboys guard Ron Leary) as well as using their first-round pick on tackle Garrett Bolles. The Broncos paid a lot of money to keep Anderson around last off-season.
21,Mark Ingram NO ,5,13,36,21.8,4.6,22.0,+1.0,Despite playing in a clear timeshare last year where he failed to see more than 18 carries in all but one game, Ingram finished as the No. 10 running back. Sure, Peterson is going to steal some work, probably slightly more than Tim Hightower did. But getting him here as the 20th running back off the board is a steal.
22,Spencer Ware KC ,10,12,39,22.2,6.0,18.0,-4.0,There are plenty of rumors coming out of camp that Kareem Hunt could lead the Chiefs backfield, though I'm not buying it just yet. Ware's struggles as the season went on coincided with their top run-blocking guard Parker Ehinger. Ware over the last two years: 286 carries for 1,325 yards (4.63 YPC) and 11 total touchdowns. We'll re-visit this as the season nears.
23,Mike Gillislee NE ,9,10,68,23.9,8.5,24.0,+1.0,If there's been one thing Gillislee has been very good at, it's running the football, and particularly well at the goal-line. Over the last two seasons he's totaled 151.2 fantasy points on 148 carries. Yeah, and now he's going to an offense where the guy he's replacing led the league with 72 redzone carries. Nobody else had more than 59. There is risk, but it's well worth it.
24,Bilal Powell NYJ ,11,14,41,25.6,5.2,31.0,+7.0,We really want to get confirmation that he's going to be the starter, but all signs point to that being the case. He totaled 411 yards on 82 carries (5.01 YPC) over the last four games of 2016 and was the No. 2 running back over that time, behind only Le'Veon Bell.
25,Eddie Lacy SEA ,6,15,43,25.9,5.8,29.0,+4.0,All weight jokes aside, Lacy has always been a bigger guy, but that didn't stop him from finishing as the No. 6 running back in back-to-back seasons to start his career. The offensive line is a problem, but it was also a problem in Green Bay, as the Packers running backs averaged a league-low 1.0 yards before contact in 2016. We're just looking for RB2 production at this point of drafts.
26,Ameer Abdullah DET ,7,16,44,26.2,4.7,27.0,+1.0,It's been a disappointing career thus far, but the Lions didn't add a goal-line back via free agency or the draft, which tells me that Abdullah will get the first crack at the starting job. Theo Riddick also had surgery on both of his wrists, which could potentially lead to more work in the passing game.
27,Frank Gore IND ,11,12,48,26.3,5.6,32.0,+5.0,We don't know how long he'll hold onto the job, seeing as he has averaged just 3.8 yards per carry since coming to the Colts. He's also scored just 10 touchdowns on the ground, leading them to use Robert Turbin in goal-line situations last year. They also drafted Marlon Mack, who could supplant Gore at any time.
28,Tevin Coleman ATL ,5,14,39,26.6,5.4,26.0,-2.0,Still feels too high for a backup running back who just lost one of the best offensive coordinators in football, but he does offer splash potential. Had just two games with more than 58 rushing yards in 2016, and touchdowns regression is all but certain.
29,Paul Perkins NYG ,8,14,64,29.2,7.1,30.0,+1.0,After the Giants passed on all free agent running backs, it appears to be the Perkins show in New York. He was better than perceived at the end of 2016, and will now be on the field with Odell Beckham Jr., Brandon Marshall, Sterling Shepard, and Evan Engram. He's going to see some light defensive fronts in a high-scoring offense.
30,LeGarrette Blount PHI ,10,15,44,29.5,5.6,23.0,-7.0,I'm not buying another double-digit touchdown season from Blount, as he's almost 31-years-old and was very mediocre outside of his time in New England. You thought Ryan Mathews was frustrating under Doug Pederson? Good luck with Blount.
31,Danny Woodhead BAL ,10,14,60,30.7,7.2,34.0,+3.0,It's tough to figure out where Woodhead fits in at this point of his career, but he's going to be fantasy-relevant out of necessity. The Ravens threw the ball more than any other team in the NFL last year, with the running backs seeing 142 of them, which was tied for the second-most in the league. He's an excellent pick in PPR leagues.
32,Adrian Peterson NO ,5,16,57,31.1,6.8,25.0,-7.0,Most have dubbed him as dead at this point in his career, though I'm not sure that's the case. The problem, however, is that Mark Ingram is likely better than him at this moment. He should see something similar to the role Tim Hightower had the last few years, making him a touchdown-dependent flex play.
33,Doug Martin TB ,11,19,59,33.6,6.8,28.0,-5.0,Coming back to a team with Mike Evans, DeSean Jackson, O.J. Howard, and Chris Godwin will be a welcoming sight for Martin, who only has three games left on his suspension. We've seen a hit-or-miss Martin over his career, but he has finished as a top-three running back twice. He could be a steal at this point.
34,Terrance West BAL ,10,16,66,34.4,8.4,41.0,+7.0,With the news of Dixon being out for the year, West skyrockets up draft boards. There is always the chance that the Ravens would be unsatisfied with West as a starter and go acquire a better back, but until then, West must be drafted in the top 40 based on expected touches alone.
35,Jonathan Stewart CAR ,11,16,66,36.1,6.8,38.0,+3.0,It's been a roller coaster of an off-season for Stewart, as he had his contract extended, but then witnessed his team select two running backs with their first two picks. While Curtis Samuel isn't a traditional running back, he will get carries. And to spend a top-eight pick on a running back says a lot how they feel about their current situation. It's hard to see Stewart finish with more than 120 carries this season and he doesn't catch passes, so we're left with non-starter type numbers. 
36,Robert Kelley WAS ,5,19,53,36.8,7.0,35.0,-1.0,Most remember Kelley for his Monday night performance against the Packers in Week 11 where he finished with 137 yards and three touchdowns, but they must've missed what ensued after that game. In the final six games of the season, Kelley averaged just 3.33 yards per carry on 84 carries with two touchdowns. He averaged just 8.05 fantasy points per game in that stretch, leading the Redskins to go out and snag Samaje Perine in the NFL Draft. You shouldn't bet on him to retain the starting job for very long, as he can only contribute on first and second down, making the offense predictable.
37,Derrick Henry TEN ,8,25,65,37.7,6.2,33.0,-4.0,It shouldn't shock you if Henry takes over as the lead-dog in the Titans backfield, as he's in his prime, while Murray is on the wrong side of 29. Henry averaged 4.96 yards per carry with four touchdowns over the final five weeks, while Murray averaged just 3.5 yards per carry and scored one touchdown over his final six games.
38,Theo Riddick DET ,7,23,57,39.4,5.3,37.0,-1.0,With Ameer Abdullah coming back, look for Riddick to go back to his change-of-pace role that he had in 2015, where he totaled over 600 yards receiving, but failed to top seven carries in any game. He's essentially the Darren Sproles of the Lions offense, but younger. 
39,Matt Forte NYJ ,11,27,57,39.6,5.9,40.0,+1.0,It was one of those situations, where Forte lost his job while trying to deal with an injury last year. Some have said that Powell was playing because Forte was hurt, but that wasn't the case over the final two weeks. Considering what the Jets are paying Forte, he's going to have a role, but you can't expect too much out of a soon-to-be 32-year-old running back.  
40,Kareem Hunt KC ,10,21,80,40.6,8.4,39.0,-1.0,There is a lot of talk in the fantasy community about the Chiefs and the future of their running back position, and rightfully so, as Andy Reid continually produces top-tier fantasy running backs. Spencer Ware wore down as the season went on, but had been one of the strengths of their offense prior to the last few weeks in the 2016 season. Hunt is likely going to take over backup duties for Charcandrick West, but will have upside for much more. It might take a few weeks to reap the full benefits of owning him, though.  
41,Samaje Perine WAS ,5,18,82,42.4,9.9,36.0,-5.0,This is based on pure assumption that Perine gets the starting job by Week 4. If he gets named the starter in the preseason, Perine would be moved into the 50-60 overall pick range. Perine can do everything Rob Kelley can do on first and second-down even better, and he can actually catch the ball. Stay tuned.
42,Duke Johnson CLE ,9,29,66,43.4,5.2,46.0,+4.0,You don't have to draft Johnson in this spot to get him, as his ADP is currently 13.11 as the 174th player off the board. Not only will Johnson have borderline flex-value while playing second-fiddle to Isaiah Crowell, but he'd be an RB1 if Crowell were to miss time. Johnson's talent is the reason he was drafted in the seventh-round last year, not because of his situation.
43,C.J. Prosise SEA ,6,30,76,44.5,6.5,43.0,0.0,We were only able to see 47 touches for the rookie in 2016, but they were extremely impressive, netting 380 total yards and a touchdown. The concern is that the Seahawks brought in Eddie Lacy, as they were clearly unhappy with the health of their running backs last year. With the versatility that Prosise offers, it shouldn't shock anyone if he gets 10-12 touches out of the gate. If he can stay healthy, Pete Carroll will find ways to utilize him in the passing game. 
44,Darren McFadden DAL ,6,21,85,53.2,16.0,55.0,+11.0,With it sounding more and more like Zeke will miss multiple games due to suspension, it is time that we take full advantage of Run DMC's low ADP. With two or three starts behind that offensive line, he is worth considering once you get into the double-digit rounds. Should Elliott end up injured, we are talking about a near-certain RB1 and his price should reflect that.
45,James White NE ,9,32,64,46.8,6.8,49.0,+4.0,The ""should have been"" Super Bowl MVP has been underrated this off-season, but not by the people that matter most. The Patriots extended him this off-season and paid him more than any other running back on the roster. He was the only player who finished in the top-36 last year without seeing at least 110 touches. If his role grows, as we expect it to, White should be in the running to finish as an RB2 in PPR leagues and a solid RB3 in standard leagues. 
46,Latavius Murray MIN ,9,25,71,47.3,7.7,42.0,-4.0,Despite finishing as the No. 13 running back in 2016, Murray wasn't very good, hence the reason the Raiders let him walk to sign a 31-year-old retired running back. Going from the Raiders offensive line that's ranked top-three in the NFL to the Vikings offensive line that ranks among the five worst was already a problem, but then he had foot surgery, and the Vikings traded up to draft Dalvin Cook in the second round. It's likely that Murray has seen his final days of fantasy relevance. 
47,Thomas Rawls SEA ,6,25,73,47.9,8.7,47.0,0.0,After averaging 5.6 yards per carry in his rookie season, Rawls just didn't look the same returning from his ankle surgery, averaging just 3.2 yards per carry. He's someone who continually works his way up my draft board, as he is reportedly looking more and more like his 2015-self. If that's the case, he could be one of the steals at the end of drafts. 
48,Jeremy Hill CIN ,6,28,66,48.3,8.2,48.0,0.0,After averaging 5.1 yards per carry in an impressive rookie campaign, Hill never regained that form, averaging just 3.67 yards per carry over the last two seasons. When looking at small sample sizes, things get dicey, but Hill has had plenty of time to showcase his abilities, as he garnered 222 carries in 2016 and 223 carries in 2015. Joe Mixon will come in and steal a lot of work right away, though Hill may still get a majority of the goal-line work, as he's scored 29 rushing touchdowns over the last three years, which is tied for the most in the NFL over that span. 
49,Jacquizz Rodgers TB ,11,31,64,48.3,7.8,44.0,-5.0,Rodgers saw a huge load of carries when Martin was down last year and the same thing could happen in the first three weeks of the season, but Charles Sims will be battling him for carries now too so try to keep the expectations more realistic. There is, however, a chance that Martin slips up and then you have a full-time starter on your hands here.
50,Jamaal Williams GB ,8,27,84,50.3,10.0,51.0,+1.0,Williams is a running back built for a workhorse role, as evidenced by his seven games with 24 or more carries with BYU last year. While Ty Montgomery may be a fine converted running back, Williams was built to carry a load. Williams is a dark horse candidate to be 2017's version of Jordan Howard. 
51,Darren Sproles PHI ,10,29,75,49.3,7.4,50.0,-1.0,Over the last three seasons while in Philadelphia, Sproles has finished with 716, 705, and 865 total yards. Pretty consistent, right? I'd say the first two are the likeliest of scenarios, because the increase last year was out of necessity with Ryan Mathews shelved. The addition of LeGarrette Blount will also take away a few scoring opportunities, but Sproles also produces for those looking for a low-upside flex option.
52,Giovani Bernard CIN ,6,31,70,50.0,7.0,59.0,+7.0,It's getting more and more likely that Bernard isn't ready for the start of the 2017 season, which would give rookie Joe Mixon a clear leg-up on the receiving duties for the Bengals. He's also coming back from a torn ACL, which could take some time for him to regain his form. A player who's offered little upside since coming into the league, he's not someone who'll help you win fantasy titles. 
53,Jamaal Charles DEN ,5,31,78,50.5,7.4,45.0,-8.0,Sadly, this may be the end for J.C. He hasn't really 'played' in a year-and-a-half, and when he did, he wasn't the same player. After attempting to return from his second torn ACL, Charles wound up having to get both of his knees cleaned out towards the end of last season. He's still not participating in OTA's, so it's very likely that Devontae Booker beats him out for the change-of-pace role behind C.J. Anderson. Even if he sticks, he'll likely max out at 8-10 touches per game. 
54,Joe Williams SF ,11,38,90,58.0,9.6,53.0,-1.0,There are all kinds of reports flying around that Carlos Hyde doesn't fit the 49ers offense and that the staff loves Joe Williams. That may be true, but Hyde is still one of the most talented running backs in the NFL and will no doubt start the season as the head back and keep the job until he melts down or has an injury. 
55,DeAndre Washington OAK ,10,39,80,58.7,8.9,66.0,+11.0,This time last year, most thought that Washington could be one of the biggest steals in drafts. The odd part about him falling down draft boards is that he actually played really well in his rookie season, averaging 5.4 yards per carry, and showing elusiveness on his receptions. If something were to happen to the 31-year-old Marshawn Lynch, Washington might just turn out to be one of the biggest steals in 2017 drafts. 
56,Rex Burkhead NE ,9,38,92,59.5,9.5,61.0,+5.0,There were plenty of fantasy players going overboard in their love for Burkhead after he totaled 119 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries in the final week of 2016, saying he was the best free agent running back on the market. Signing with New England didn't quiet those who adored him, though the signing of Mike Gillislee did, as did the extension for James White. Burkhead may be talented, but he's buried on a team that will use a different running back every week. He very well could be the new Brandon Bolden. He's a better best-ball target in case he does indeed see 8-10 touches per week. 
57,Dion Lewis NE ,9,37,77,59.0,8.6,60.0,+3.0, 
58,Jonathan Williams BUF ,6,40,92,58.7,9.2,52.0,-6.0,Last season, the Bills offensive-line was by far the most efficient in the NFL and wouldn't you know it, they led the NFL with 28 rushing touchdowns. Now that Gillislee is gone, it should be Williams' turn to step into double-digit goal-line opportunities and plenty of carries in the run-heavy scheme.
59,Alvin Kamara NO ,5,34,91,58.5,8.5,65.0,+6.0,The Saints backfield has been top-five in fantasy points over the last five years, so when looking at a running back like Kamara this late in drafts, it should get you excited. He's immediately the best receiving option out of the backfield, which should see an extended role with the Brandin Cooks departure. 
60,Chris Thompson WAS ,5,41,80,58.8,8.3,83.0,+23.0,While some argue about Robert Kelley and Samaje Perine until they're blue in the face, Thompson continues to be looked over. Most don't realize that Thompson finished as the No. 28 running back in PPR leagues last year, and that was with Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson on the roster. His role can actually grow despite the addition of Perine. 
61,Marlon Mack IND ,11,44,93,61.2,10.8,54.0,-7.0,If you're looking for a high-upside pick towards the end of your draft, Mack fits the bill. He is lightning-in-a-bottle, while Frank Gore and Robert Turbin are more like a light drizzle at this point in time. If he gets the opportunity to start at any point in the season, you can pencil Mack in as an RB2, regardless of opponent. The offense is built for a player like him, and it's what they've been missing over the last few years, a running back who can make splash plays. 
62,Shane Vereen NYG ,8,43,91,62.4,10.0,72.0,+10.0, 
63,Jalen Richard OAK ,10,45,78,61.0,7.3,56.0,-7.0, 
64,Devontae Booker DEN ,5,39,100,66.9,8.6,67.0,+3.0, 
65,D'Onta Foreman HOU ,7,45,88,61.8,9.3,71.0,+6.0,Landing behind Lamar Miller may have been the best thing for someone like Foreman, as Miller seems to be a player who is best suited for a timeshare. Foreman is also a bigger back who could see goal-line duties right away, as Miller was one of just two running backs to score fewer than six rushing touchdowns with at least 215 carries (Frank Gore was the other). 
66,Charles Sims TB ,11,43,90,61.0,7.7,62.0,-4.0,One of the most unpredictable players of the last three years, Sims has averaged just 2.8 and 2.9 yards per carry in two of three seasons, but looked like a different player in between when he averaged 4.9 yards per carry in 2015 and added 51 receptions for 561 yards and four touchdowns under Dirk Koetter. He looks to have lost the backup job to Jacquizz Rodgers, but if he wasn't healthy for all of last season, there may still be hope. He should still have a passing down role when Doug Martin returns from suspension, while Rodgers likely won't. 
67,Tim Hightower SF ,11,46,85,67.4,9.2,74.0,+7.0,

72,James Conner PIT ,9,45,94,68.8,9.3,69.0,-3.0,Walking into what is arguably the best handcuff in all of fantasy football, Conner is worth a bench spot in fantasy leagues. Over the last two years, there have been three running backs to start for the Steelers. Le'Veon Bell averaged 26.3 touches per game, DeAngelo Williams averaged 22.8, and even Fitzgerald Toussaint averaged 18.0. They are one of the few teams that believes in a one-back system and also happen to be one of the highest-scoring teams in the league.

86,Wayne Gallman NYG ,8,58,95,73.7,8.5,,,Apparently, Paul Perkins has a big lead in the running back battle, if there is one at all, but based on talent alone, Gallman might have the upper hand and it is only a matter of time before the Giants' coaching staff notices that and plugs him in for enough carries to warrant owning.
