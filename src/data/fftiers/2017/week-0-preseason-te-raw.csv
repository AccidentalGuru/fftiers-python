1,Rob Gronkowski NE ,9,1,6,1.2,0.7,1.0,0.0,A game-changer at the toughest position to predict. The gap has gotten a tad smaller from what it used to be, but Gronkowski had given you back-to-back 1,100-yard seasons before getting injured in 2016. He gives you an advantage whenever he's in the lineup and is worth the risk.
2,Travis Kelce KC ,10,1,4,2.0,0.5,2.0,0.0,It's possible that the Chiefs finally figured out how to use Kelce, as he totaled 8.2 targets per game over the final 10 games of the season, after averaging just 5.9 targets per game over the first 38 games of his career. He finished as the No. 1 tight end while scoring just four touchdowns. There's still room to grow.
3,Greg Olsen CAR ,11,2,7,3.6,0.9,3.0,0.0,Call him boring, but he's been a top-four tight end for each of the last three years and hasn't finished outside of the top-eight since 2011. The concern is that he was just the No. 14 tight end from Week 8 through Week 17.
4,Jordan Reed WAS ,5,2,12,4.2,1.5,4.0,0.0,The only remaining players Kirk Cousins will have in the offense from last year are Reed and Jamison Crowder. One of them is 6'2â€, 243 pounds, and a monster in the endzone. His health is always the concern, which is why he's a fifth-round pick instead of a third or fourth.
5,Jimmy Graham SEA ,6,2,11,5.2,1.6,5.0,0.0,I'm likely lower than most, but Graham really struggled down the stretch, even with Russell Wilson coming on. After totaling 89 or more yards in four of the first eight games, Graham failed to top 67 yards the remainder of the season. He's still a solid pick, just not the top-three pick that he always was.
6,Tyler Eifert CIN ,6,4,11,6.3,1.7,6.0,0.0,Now has 18 touchdowns over the last two seasons despite playing in just 21 games and being targeted 121 times. No player has a higher touchdown rate over the last two seasons, including Rob Gronkowski. If it appears he'll start the season healthy, he'll move up this list.
7,Kyle Rudolph MIN ,9,3,16,7.9,2.2,9.0,+2.0,People left the bandwagon too early on him, myself included. But when you see the chemistry between him and Sam Bradford, you should be buying in. He saw a position-high 132 targets last year, including 8.7 per game once offensive coordinator Pat Shurmer took over. Keep in mind that he finished as the No. 3 tight end, while both Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs got theirs.
8,Delanie Walker TEN ,8,3,13,8.3,2.0,8.0,0.0,Going from seeing 133 targets in 2015, to just 102 last season is quite the difference for a tight end. The additions of Rishard Matthews and Tajae Sharpe proved to be enough to decrease his workload, but now they've added two even better players in Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor. He'll also be 33-years-old before the season starts.
9,Martellus Bennett GB ,8,6,15,9.8,2.2,7.0,-2.0,While the Packers offense doesn't necessarily target the tight end position that much, Bennett was someone who they went out and paid good money to acquire. The projections aren't this high on him, but there's massive upside if they do change things up a bit.
10,Zach Ertz PHI ,10,6,19,10.4,2.3,10.0,0.0,After banging on the table that Ertz is volume dependent for the last two years, fantasy players will start to see why this season. After seeing over 300 targets the last three seasons (was one of just four tight ends who saw at least 100 targets in each of the last two seasons), Ertz's best finish sits as the No. 8 tight end in 2016, when it was a really low scoring year for the position as a whole. After seeing them add Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith via free agency, Ertz is going to need to get much more efficient if he wants to finish as a top-12 tight end. 
11,Eric Ebron DET ,7,6,16,10.6,2.2,14.0,+3.0,Despite missing three games last year, Ebron finished with the eighth-most yards among tight ends. Had he continued on the same pace for all 16 games, he would have only trailed Travis Kelce, Greg Olsen, and Jimmy Graham. With Anquan Boldin gone, it frees up plenty of targets for both him and Marvin Jones in the red-zone. He could be the tight end drafted outside the top-15 who finishes top-five. 
12,Hunter Henry LAC ,9,5,19,11.0,2.4,11.0,-1.0,I get it, he finished as the No. 11 tight end in his rookie season. He also saw just 53 targets despite Keenan Allen, Travis Benjamin, Antonio Gates, and Melvin Gordon being hurt at times during the year. That was also before Mike Williams was drafted at No. 7 overall. Unless Henry scores a touchdown every 6.6 targets like he did last year, it's unlikely he comes close to his current TE8 ADP.
13,Jack Doyle IND ,11,8,33,12.9,4.1,12.0,-1.0,Despite playing alongside Dwayne Allen and with a less-than-100-percent Andrew Luck, Doyle was able to finish as the No. 13 tight end last year, yet his ADP is currently in the 13th round as the 16th tight end off the board. If Doyle isn't in your top-12 tight ends, you should be expecting big things from Erik Swoope.
14,Coby Fleener NO ,5,8,25,15.6,3.2,22.0,+8.0,Most don't realize that Fleener finished as the No. 12 fantasy tight end last year, despite playing what seemed to be his worst year as a professional. While it was a down year for the tight end position as a whole, it just goes to show how unpredictable the position is. When you have Drew Brees throwing to you, it's hard to say that many other tight ends have the weekly ceiling that Fleener does. With Brandin Cooks off to New England, someone needs to step up in the passing game, especially over the middle of the field. 
15,Jason Witten DAL ,6,12,29,17.2,3.0,15.0,0.0,Boring, sure, but Witten hasn't finished outside the top-14 at his position since 2003, his rookie year. Looking at the Cowboys schedule, it looks better for him than it does for Dez Bryant, who will see a lot of the league's top-tier cornerbacks. If you're looking for a low-upside, though safe option at an extremely volatile position, Witten is the guy for you. 
16,Cameron Brate TB ,11,10,28,18.0,3.8,21.0,+5.0,Don't be scared off by the fact that the Bucs drafted O.J. Howard and to a lesser extent, Chris Godwin. Sure, Howard is a great tight end prospect, but rookie tight ends rarely perform, and the fact is, Brate was #1 in the NFL in yards per route run so there is reason to believe he will again be an large part of the Bucs' offense.
17,Julius Thomas MIA ,11,9,29,18.3,3.8,17.0,0.0,Going back to play with Adam Gase has a lot of fantasy owners expecting big things, but Thomas needs to stay on the field before anything. There are plenty of other targets in the offense that it's hard to see him seeing more than 4-5 targets per week. Did you know that there were just six games he finished with more than 28 yards while playing with the Jaguars (span of 21 games)?
18,C.J. Fiedorowicz HOU ,7,14,32,18.3,3.6,28.0,+10.0,Fiedorowicz is by no means the most talented tight end or in anywhere near the best situation, but he does have opportunity on his side. His 89 targets last season was top 10 at the position and 12 of those were in the red zone which is more than AJ Green, Julio Jones and Brandin Cooks.
19,Austin Hooper ATL ,5,7,27,18.4,3.5,23.0,+4.0,Expecting him to get more snaps/targets, Hooper was extremely efficient with his looks last year. Despite seeing more than three targets just three times, he rattled off six games with at least 41 yards and/or a touchdown. The Falcons didn't re-sign Jacob Tamme, showing confidence in the rookie going forward.  
20,Antonio Gates LAC ,9,8,27,19.0,3.3,16.0,-4.0,I'll be the first to admit that we all might have the 37-year-old Gates too low on our lists, but everything is going against him here. They not only drafted his replacement Hunter Henry last year, but he proved to be ready to take over the main role. Gates is likely coming back to secure the all-time record for touchdowns among tight ends, as he needs just one more to break the record. 
21,O.J. Howard TB ,11,9,39,22.5,5.1,13.0,-8.0,Labeled as the most pro-ready tight end to come out of the NFL Draft in a long time, Howard landed on a Bucs team that apparently still wants to use last year's breakout tight end Cameron Brate. He'll get snaps, but on a team with so many targets in the passing game, it's better to just pass in year-one. 
22,Jared Cook OAK ,10,14,32,23.1,3.9,24.0,+2.0, 
23,Zach Miller CHI ,9,15,38,26.1,5.8,31.0,+8.0,Miller missed 6 weeks last season, but in terms of points per game, he outscored both Martellus Bennett and Eric Ebron, who are being drafted as TE1s. The Bears' tight end was phenomenal to close the 2015 season as well so don't sleep on him as a potential surprise piece this season.
24,David Njoku CLE ,9,16,36,24.1,4.0,25.0,+1.0,It's rare for a rookie tight end to make an impact, but if there's one to bet on this year, it's Njoku. Immediately after drafting him, the Browns cut Gary Barnidge, leaving only Njoku and sophomore Seth DeValve on the roster. He's not much of a blocker just yet, so he should be running a lot of routes when he is on the field. 
25,Evan Engram NYG ,8,17,36,24.0,3.7,18.0,-7.0,If you're unaware of what type of tight end Engram is, I'll tell you this... He's a wide receiver with a tight end tag, similar to the way Aaron Hernandez was with the Patriots. When watching Engram, he looks similar to Jordan Matthews, a big slot receiver. This is an issue because he'll be competing for snaps with sophomore Sterling Shepard. He also doesn't block well, which doesn't bode well for his ability to stay on the field in 11 personnel. 
26,Dwayne Allen NE ,9,15,39,26.8,4.8,19.0,-7.0,Allen might not be the same quality of player as Martellus Bennett, but the fact that the Pats' backup tight end (who played injured all season) finished #7 among TEs in fantasy points last season should tell you plenty. Gronk has injury risk and Brady will find Allen in the end zone. He has TE1 upside and a useful fantasy floor.
27,Charles Clay BUF ,6,16,34,25.8,4.1,32.0,+5.0,Labeling him as a sleeper feels right, as most don't realize Clay totaled 209 yards and four touchdowns in his final three games with Tyrod Taylor. All of those games took place in the fantasy playoffs, which is why I figured there'd be more attention on him in early drafts. If you're looking for an upside tight end late in drafts, Clay could be your guy. 
28,Ladarius Green FA ,,12,102,37.7,17.7,29.0,+1.0, 
29,Jesse James PIT ,9,15,44,26.2,4.9,26.0,-3.0,James was not impressive last season, but the Steelers did cut LaDarius Green to make him the starter this year. When you consider that Pittsburgh will score 400+ points, you have to believe James will get his hand on 5+ scores if he stays healthy.
30,Austin Seferian-Jenkins NYJ ,11,16,42,27.9,5.6,27.0,-3.0, 
31,Benjamin Watson BAL ,10,18,47,30.4,5.6,,,

40,Will Tye NYG ,8,24,53,41.1,7.4,,, 
41,Jermaine Gresham ARI ,8,24,46,32.4,4.6,,,Most seemed to miss the fact that Gresham finished the year posting at least 32 yards in 8 of 9 games, including four games in a row with 40 or more yards. It's not going to win you a week or anything, but at a position that you'll sometimes get zeroes out of, he's a safe bet for top-20 production in any given week.
