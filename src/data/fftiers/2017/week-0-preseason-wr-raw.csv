1,Antonio Brown PIT ,9,1,3,1.1,0.4,1.0,0.0,It's now four straight seasons where Brown has finished as a top-seven wide receiver, including two seasons as the No. 1 receiver. He's averaged 1,579 yards and 10.8 touchdowns in that span, and keep in mind that he posted his two best seasons while Martavis Bryant was on the field with him.
2,Odell Beckham Jr. NYG ,8,1,6,2.5,0.8,3.0,+1.0,You're nit-picking when trying to decipher between Beckham, Jones, and Brown, but the area of concern for Beckham is his newfound competition for targets. Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram are going to see targets, potentially lowering Beckham's 169 target ceiling from last year. He's talented enough to make up for the decrease, but still a tick below Jones and Brown for me.
3,Julio Jones ATL ,5,1,7,2.9,1.1,2.0,-1.0,Losing Kyle Shanahan isn't going to help a lot of the skill-position players, but Jones is the exception here. Prior to the 2016 season, Jones averaged 11.8 targets per game from 2013-2015. That number went down to 9.2 targets last year and he missed two games, yet he still managed to finish as the No. 6 fantasy receiver. If he puts together a complete season, he could break records.
4,A.J. Green CIN ,6,2,7,4.7,1.1,5.0,+1.0,Green was dominating in 2016 before going down with a season-ending injury in Week 11. Throughout the first 10 weeks of the season, Green was the No. 4 fantasy receiver and on pace for over 1,700 yards and seven touchdowns. In the years he played all 16 games, his finishes are WR4, WR4, and WR7. Stay healthy, A.J.
5,Mike Evans TB ,11,1,10,4.7,1.3,4.0,-1.0,It's fair to say that Evans' sophomore season with just three touchdowns was an outlier, as he's scored 12 in each of his other two seasons. Had he scored his usual 12 touchdowns in 2015, he would have finished as the No. 7 wide receiver. Combine that with his No. 1 finish last year and No. 10 finish in 2014, and you have a safe first-round pick.
6,Jordy Nelson GB ,8,2,10,5.7,1.4,6.0,0.0,It's coming to the point in his career where he'll take a turn in the wrong direction, but he didn't show any signs of that in 2016, finishing with 14 touchdowns. His yardage did slip to the lowest it's been since 2010 (sans injured 2012), and it'll likely continue to do so, but you can bank on double-digit touchdowns.
7,Michael Thomas NO ,5,3,11,7.3,1.4,7.0,0.0,It was quite the rookie campaign for Thomas, totaling 1,137 yards and nine touchdowns in 15 games, and that's despite not becoming a full-time player until Week 3. In his 13 games as a starter, Thomas went on a 16-game pace of 101/1,259/11. Brandin Cooks is gone and Ted Ginn is the only wide receiver they replaced him with. Thomas is going to be a WR1 as long as Brees is under center.
8,T.Y. Hilton IND ,11,6,17,8.8,1.9,9.0,+1.0,Did you know that Hilton led the league in receiving yards last year? He finished with 81 more yards than Odell Beckham Jr., though he scored just six touchdowns, which is the reason he's further down draft boards. It's now four straight 1,000-yard seasons for Hilton and Andrew Luck should finally be healthy this season.
9,Dez Bryant DAL ,6,6,15,8.8,1.8,8.0,-1.0,He'd be much higher on this list if he didn't have to go up against the Giants twice (held him to two catches for 18 yards on 14 targets last year), Josh Norman twice, Broncos, Cardinals, Falcons, and Seahawks. The Cowboys don't have a legit No. 2 receiver to take attention away from Bryant, but despite that, he still slides in as my No. 10 receiver.
10,Amari Cooper OAK ,10,7,17,10.7,1.9,10.0,0.0,The fact that he finished as the No. 12 wide receiver despite catching just five touchdowns and seeing 13 redzone targets says something about his potential. His efficiency spiked in his second year with Derek Carr and Michael Crabtree will be on the wrong side of 30 when the season starts.
11,Doug Baldwin SEA ,6,6,19,11.1,2.3,12.0,+1.0,He's now finished as a top-10 wide receiver in back-to-back seasons, and that was despite Russell Wilson taking a slight step back last year, though it was likely injury-related. His target numbers have gone up four straight seasons, as have the Seahawks pass attempts. They are attempting to get their run-game going again, but Baldwin is who moves the sticks.
12,DeAndre Hopkins HOU ,7,8,22,13.7,2.6,13.0,+1.0,Who would've thought that we'd love to have Brian Hoyer back in order to throw to Hopkins? A year after his breakout 1,500-yard season, Hopkins totaled just 954 yards on 151 targets. Those who have high hopes for him are likely depending on rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson taking over in fast order.
13,Brandin Cooks NE ,9,8,27,14.2,4.1,11.0,-2.0,Most players would see their efficiency go up when heading to the Patriots, but coming from the Saints and Drew Brees, it's unlikely. In a recent study I did, the Saints wide receivers have totaled 24 WR1 performances over the last three years, compared to 17 for the Patriots. He'll have WR1 weeks, but he'll be frustrating to own.
14,Demaryius Thomas DEN ,5,10,25,14.8,2.9,14.0,0.0,Last season was the first one since 2011 where Thomas failed to record at least 1,300 yards, as he totaled just 1,083 with Trevor Siemian under center. The Broncos have added Carlos Henderson to the wide receiving corps, giving another playmaker who'll garner targets. Thomas is a solid third-round pick, though he lacks the upside I'm looking for.
15,Allen Robinson JAC ,8,9,26,16.0,3.2,18.0,+3.0,Betting on Robinson's talent to shine through, his targets are likely to decrease this year with the acquisition of Leonard Fournette, as well as a beefed-up defense. Despite having the exact same number of targets in each of the last two seasons, Robinson finished with a 517 yard and eight touchdown difference in 2016. There is built-in risk.
16,Alshon Jeffery PHI ,10,9,35,17.7,4.0,16.0,0.0,Battling injuries over the last two seasons where he's played just 22 games, Jeffery hasn't been the same without Marc Trestman. If he's going to live up to his mid-third-round ADP, he's going to have to score double-digit touchdowns.
17,Terrelle Pryor WAS ,5,8,36,18.0,5.0,17.0,0.0,He impressed stat-wise in his first full year at wide receiver, but he also saw 140 targets, which ranked 12th among wide receivers. During his time as the starting quarterback, Kirk Cousins has not targeted any wide receiver more than 6.9 times per game, which would equivalate to 110 over a full season. It's hard to see him finishing better than a low-end WR2.
18,Davante Adams GB ,8,9,36,19.1,4.8,21.0,+3.0,From Week 4 on last season, the only wide receivers to outscore Adams were: Odell Beckham Jr., Jordy Nelson, Antonio Brown, and Mike Evans. That is it. Nelson will be playing at age-32 this season. 
19,Keenan Allen LAC ,9,10,38,19.7,4.8,19.0,0.0,In 27 career games with 10 or less targets, Allen has averaged just 3.96 receptions and 49.2 yards per game, compared to the 11 games where he's seen 11 or more targets and averaged 10.36 receptions and 117.8 yards per game. With all the mouths to feed, it's hard to see him getting more than 10 in many games.
20,Sammy Watkins LAR ,8,11,40,20.2,6.2,15.0,-5.0,If you extend Watkins' 8 games out to a full season, he would have just had 860 yards and 4 touchdowns, which is worse than Adam Thielen, but consider that over the previous 14 healthy games he has outperformed Antonio Brown. Granted, he is playing with perhaps the worst QB in football now, but there is still a considerable ceiling.
21,Michael Crabtree OAK ,10,14,35,20.5,3.6,23.0,+2.0,There's a good possibility that Crabtree regresses this season, as he scored 55.7 of his 150 fantasy points on just 23 redzone targets in 2016. That was a far cry from his 13.8 points on 13 targets in 2015.
22,Golden Tate DET ,7,13,46,24.2,5.4,26.0,+4.0,After starting the year as a droppable fantasy asset, Tate totaled 943 yards and four touchdowns over the final 11 games in 2016, which was good enough to be the No. 10 wide receiver in that span. The Lions lost Anquan Boldin and replaced him with a late third-round rookie.
23,Emmanuel Sanders DEN ,5,17,49,25.5,5.2,29.0,+6.0,Did you know he's now 30-years-old? He's also the No. 2 receiver on a team that wants to run the ball more in 2017. His year was very up-and-down in 2016 and you should expect more of the same in 2017.
24,Larry Fitzgerald ARI ,8,14,43,26.0,5.1,31.0,+7.0,Entering what is likely his last NFL season, Fitzgerald has now put up back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons with Carson Palmer behind center. They added Chad Williams via the draft, but he needs time to develop. The only competition he has for targets over the middle of the field is David Johnson. Fitzgerald was also sixth in redzone targets last year with 23 of them.
25,Jarvis Landry MIA ,11,16,39,26.2,5.4,22.0,-3.0,Surely lower than most, I'm expecting Devante Parker to take a step forward in 2017. After averaging nine targets per game over the first 36 games of his career, Landry averaged just 7.1 targets over the final 12 games under Adam Gase. He's somewhat safe in PPR leagues, but there's not a whole lot of upside here.
26,Tyreek Hill KC ,10,10,54,26.5,7.1,20.0,-6.0,I can understand moving Hill up your list if you draft on upside alone, though I'm expecting massive regression with Hill. Not only did he score three special teams touchdowns, but he also scored nine rushing/receiving touchdowns on just 85 offensive touches (one every 9.4 touches). No receiver with more than 45 receptions scored a touchdown more than one every 10.1 targets in 2016, and that was Davante Adams who catches passes from Aaron Rodgers. Outside of Packers receivers, the next highest was Anquan Boldin at one every 11.9 targets. Hill is still catching passes from Alex Smith the last I checked, so I'm not betting on his crazy touchdown per touch ratio happening again.
27,Martavis Bryant PIT ,9,13,46,27.0,6.8,24.0,-3.0,Don't sleep on how good Bryant was when on the field, as eight of his 21 career games have netted 14 or more standard fantasy points, including four of them with 20 or more. The Steelers just cut Ladarius Green, freeing up even more targets than initially thought.
28,Julian Edelman NE ,9,14,42,28.6,5.4,25.0,-3.0,When the Patriots traded for Brandin Cooks, I was legitimately concerned about Edelman's role going forward. That was until they extended him for another two years. You can't expect anywhere near the 9.7 targets per game that he's seen over the last four years, but he's obviously part of their plans. He was never a touchdown scorer, so it's hard to rely on him as anything more than a low-upside WR3. 
29,Jamison Crowder WAS ,5,20,41,29.9,4.7,32.0,+3.0,I wanted to put Crowder higher in my rankings, but without knocking Terrelle Pryor into low-end WR3 territory, it wasn't happening. Crowder scored as many touchdowns as DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon combined last year (7), but still saw fewer targets than the both of them. Love the player, not necessarily the situation.
30,Willie Snead NO ,5,14,48,31.0,5.2,34.0,+4.0,He's been under-the-radar this off-season, despite the trade that sent Brandin Cooks away. While they play different roles, the absence of Cooks clears up 120-plus targets. He may have had the quietest top-35 season ever in 2016. Did you know he finished with more fantasy points than DeAndre Hopkins?
31,Kelvin Benjamin CAR ,11,18,65,31.1,6.9,28.0,-3.0,He's finished inside the top-20 wide receivers in both seasons he's played, but it's hard to feel confident in him, knowing that he's had weight issues for the second-straight off-season. The additions of Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel will likely eat up some of the shorter targets that used to go to him.
32,Stefon Diggs MIN ,9,21,45,31.2,5.5,27.0,-5.0,It was an injury-plagued year for Diggs in 2016, as he was either OUT or on the injury report 10 times. When he played through injuries, he totaled just 4.0 receptions and 37.3 yards per game. When he was off the injury report, he averaged 9.3 receptions and 107.0 yards per game.
33,Donte Moncrief IND ,11,22,50,32.8,5.7,33.0,0.0,Over the last two seasons, there have been just four games in which both Andrew Luck and Moncrief played in where they didn't connect for a touchdown. Luck is finally healthy and Moncrief is entering a contract-year. 
34,Brandon Marshall NYG ,8,19,45,33.3,6.4,30.0,-4.0,If you want to take away targets from Odell Beckham Jr. in order to get Marshall into WR2 territory, you can take that venture, but I won't be on it. He's entering his age-34 season and he just came off a season where he saw 128 targets, yet finished as the No. 52 receiver. The last time someone saw more than 120 targets and finished outside the top 36 was 2014, where both Vincent Jackson and Andre Johnson accomplished that feat. They are both out of football at this point.
35,DeSean Jackson TB ,11,23,50,34.6,5.1,35.0,0.0,He'll be drafted much higher than this, but Jackson is going to find it tough to crack the top-30 with Mike Evans on the other side of the field. This was a better real-life football signing than it was for fantasy purposes. He'll turn 31-years-old at the end of the season.
36,Pierre Garcon SF ,11,23,90,36.3,10.1,36.0,0.0,One of my favorite targets in season-long leagues, Garcon is going to give you what you pay for. The last season he played under Kyle Shanahan was 2013 when he led the NFL in targets with 182 of them. The 49ers paid him a lot of money to come there, and he's legitimately their only starting-caliber receiver.
37,Eric Decker TEN ,8,20,54,38.8,6.6,37.0,0.0,It's unclear as to what is going on with Decker right now, but as of now, we have to assume he's on the team. He's played with some horrid quarterbacks during his career, yet he's totaled at least 962 yards or eight touchdowns in every season he's been a starter, as well as finishing as a top-36 receiver.
38,Jeremy Maclin BAL ,10,21,67,39.6,7.4,40.0,+2.0,In what was probably the best move for his fantasy value, Maclin was released by the Chiefs only to be picked up by the Ravens just a few days later. It's rare for the Chiefs to total more than 500 pass attempts, while the Ravens led the NFL with 678 pass attempts last year. They also lost Steve Smith, whose role now belongs to Maclin. Over his time with the Ravens, Smith totaled 8.32 targets per game. If Maclin takes over that role and sees 130 targets, he's a steal at his current ADP. 
39,Tyrell Williams LAC ,9,18,53,39.4,7.0,45.0,+6.0,Just one year after finishing as the No. 13 wide receiver, there are plenty of question marks surrounding Williams. Not only is Keenan Allen returning from injury, but the Chargers surprised everyone by drafting Mike Williams with the No. 7 pick in the draft. Competition for targets is the key here, and by the Chargers actions, they'll be hard to come by for last year's breakout receiver. He still offers plenty of upside later in drafts. 
40,Devante Parker MIA ,11,22,60,40.0,6.4,43.0,+3.0,This could be a steal if the hype surrounding him this off-season turns out to be true. The coaches questioned him publicly last year, but have gone out of their way to praise him this off-season, going all-in on the third-year receiver. There were glimpses last year, when he had five games with 79 or more yards, despite seeing more than seven targets just three times.
41,Cameron Meredith CHI ,9,20,67,41.0,7.9,38.0,-3.0,Despite catching passes from the same quarterbacks and seeing essentially the same number of targets, Meredith finished with 67 more yards and two more touchdowns than Alshon Jeffery last year. He suffered a broken thumb during OTA's which could derail his ascension up the depth chart, as he's out until training camp. There is plenty of risk considering the Bears signing Victor Cruz, Kendall Wright, and Marcus Wheaton, but we also know that there's plenty of upside. 
42,John Brown ARI ,8,19,62,42.0,7.6,44.0,+2.0,There are a lot of people sleeping on the No. 21 wide receiver from just two years ago, and that was with a younger Larry Fitzgerald and redzone threat Michael Floyd. All-in-all, he played less than 40 snaps per game in 2016 due to his sickle cell trait, but it's now under control. Steal of drafts right now.
43,Kenny Britt CLE ,9,30,56,42.3,5.7,46.0,+3.0,Some are calling Britt a steal where he's being drafted, but I'd say that he's right where he should be. Did you know that he had never totaled more than 775 yards in any one season before 2016? Or how about the fact that he has recorded more than five touchdowns just once in his career? Now he's going to a team that's got Corey Coleman, an up-and-coming phenom, and David Njoku, the top tight end prospect on some analysts boards. But the real story is that he's going to be catching passes from either Cody Kessler, a quarterback who threw just six touchdowns on 195 attempts last year, or DeShone Kizer, a rookie whose college coach said that he should still be in college. 
44,Randall Cobb GB ,8,27,59,44.0,5.1,39.0,-5.0,If you're going to bet on any player to bounce back from a bad season, bet on a player who has Aaron Rodgers throwing him the football. Cobb has finished as a top-12 wide receiver (points per game) twice in his career, and still showed flashes despite struggling to play through injuries for much of the year.  Jordy Nelson is 32-years-old and Davante Adams still has a lot to prove. 
45,Jordan Matthews BUF ,6,20,60,44.3,7.9,53.0,+8.0,With Sammy Watkins out of Buffalo and Matthews in as presumably the team's #1 receiver, Matthews ceiling bumps to a low-end WR2. The Bills will be bad enough this season that they should have plenty of positive game scripts for the passing game.
46,Mike Wallace BAL ,10,35,72,46.0,6.7,52.0,+6.0,The Ravens likely held onto his contract because they didn't have another receiver to step up and command 100-plus targets this season, and they didn't draft one either. Wallace has finished as a top-28 wide receiver in seven of his eight seasons and is in a good position to do the same in 2017.
47,Corey Coleman CLE ,9,37,58,46.7,4.7,42.0,-5.0,Drafted to be a game-changer, Coleman will look to get back on track after an injury-filled rookie season where we saw glimpses of the player he could be. Kenny Britt will command targets, sure, but nowhere close to the 140 that Terrelle Pryor saw last year. It shouldn't shock you if Coleman finishes as a top-24 wide receiver in 2017.
48,Adam Thielen MIN ,9,34,61,46.8,5.0,47.0,-1.0,Despite the fact that I'm a huge Stefon Diggs fan, one cannot escape the fact that Thielen saw 20 fewer targets, yet finished with 64 more yards and two more touchdowns. Once Diggs moved into the slot, Thielen started to do most of his damage, including his 202-yard, two touchdown performance in Week 16 against the Packers. He's still got a lot to prove, but 2016 was incredibly promising for the former undrafted free agent. 
49,Corey Davis TEN ,8,13,93,48.9,11.4,41.0,-8.0,He's an amazing talent and one that should be a force in the league for years to come, but it's a rare scenario in which a rookie comes in at wide receiver to dominate right away. Settling him in the WR3 range is the most likely of scenarios.
50,Rishard Matthews TEN ,8,27,76,48.2,7.3,49.0,-1.0,He's not going to just disappear now that Corey Davis is in town, but he was due for touchdown regression regardless. There were just two wide receivers with more than 100 targets who caught more touchdowns on a per target basis, Jordy Nelson and Davante Adams. They both have Aaron Rodgers throwing to them.
51,Marvin Jones DET ,7,40,80,50.3,5.7,48.0,-3.0,Just how good was Marvin Jones' start to 2016? Good enough that despite totaling just 448 yards and two touchdowns over the final 12 weeks, that he still finished as a top-40 wide receiver. His 482 yards and two touchdowns over the first four games were good enough to be the No. 3 receiver, behind only Julio Jones and Antonio Brown. With Anquan Boldin gone, we should see Jones' touchdown total shoot up. There's room for WR2 numbers in this offense. 
52,Ted Ginn NO ,5,43,98,55.8,10.6,58.0,+6.0,It's quite possible that Ginn moves up the rankings if we see him in two wide receiver sets for the Saints. While Cam Newton's arm fit his skill-set, he's now got one of the best deep ball quarterbacks in the league throwing to him. Ginn is a fantastic bench player to draft, and once he has a big week, sell high, as he won't carry much week-to-week consistency.  
53,Sterling Shepard NYG ,8,38,82,57.2,7.5,51.0,-2.0,There were 41 players who saw at least 100 targets in 2016, and just four scored more touchdowns on a per-target basis: Davante Adams, Jordy Nelson, Rishard Matthews, and Antonio Brown. Not too bad for a rookie, right? The additions of Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram cloud his outlook, but he just might surprise people who take a chance on him later in drafts. 
54,Josh Doctson WAS ,5,44,89,58.7,9.2,57.0,+3.0,Don't forget that Doctson was the No. 1 pick for the Redskins last year and that head coach Jay Gruden compared him to A.J. Green. All reports coming back from OTA's were positive and beat reporters are saying that he'll attempt to take over the Pierre Garcon role. This would be great news, as Garcon has seen 111 and 114 targets over the last two years. 
55,Kevin White CHI ,9,41,95,59.8,9.4,54.0,-1.0,It's been an incredibly disappointing start to White's career, but the Bears are going to give him every opportunity to live up to his draft spot in 2017. They're concerned about his health and whether or not it has affected his speed in and out of his breaks, but as long as he's on the field, he'll be targeted by Mike Glennon. If he plays all 16 games, it's hard to see any scenario where he doesn't see at least 110 targets. If that's the case, he should finish in the WR3/4 range.  
56,Tyler Lockett SEA ,6,42,78,57.8,5.9,55.0,-1.0,Lockett's career may essentially be over, but it is worth remembering that he was Tyreek Hill just 18 months ago. Should he end up healthy, we could see a top 25 wide receiver explode back onto the scene. 
57,Breshad Perriman BAL ,10,43,81,59.3,7.6,60.0,+3.0,As discussed earlier in this article, the Ravens threw the ball more than any other team in 2016 and they lost 151 of their targets to wide receivers this off-season (Steve Smith and Kamar Aiken). Perriman may never live up to the expectations some set for him, but he may be a WR3 on volume alone in 2017.
58,Kenny Stills MIA ,11,41,84,59.4,6.8,69.0,+11.0,It'd be natural to expect a regression for Stills, as most are expecting Devante Parker to come out of his shell this year, but the Dolphins did spend a lot of money to keep Stills in place. He also happened to get better as the year went on in 2016, finishing with 9.5 or more standard fantasy points in seven of the last 10 games. He's a volatile option, but you can definitely do worse than him for a bye week option. 
59,Zay Jones BUF ,6,39,99,62.6,12.1,61.0,+2.0,Was a target-hog in college and posted video game numbers because of it. He'll operate over the middle of the field for the Bills and would see a massive bump in targets if Sammy Watkins were to have any setbacks. He's one of the rookies that will have a role out of neccessity.
60,Robert Woods LAR ,8,42,106,63.5,13.6,76.0,+16.0,He was extremely inefficient in his time with the Bills, but he did flash in a few games last season, leading the Rams to pony up some dough this offseason. It'll be interesting to see how they use him after drafting slot receiver Cooper Kupp at the start of the third round. 
61,Robby Anderson NYJ ,11,42,99,65.4,13.0,65.0,+4.0,With Enunwa now out for the season, Anderson is expected to step up as the top receiving option for the Jets. While they will be playing most games from behind, the QB situation is not ideal so his upside is limited to a WR3.
62,Cole Beasley DAL ,6,46,102,64.8,10.0,59.0,-3.0,A solid bye week filler in PPR leagues, Beasley finished as a WR3 in 7 of 16 games last year, but he lacks any ceiling. He now also has competition on the roster with rookie Ryan Switzer, who is nearly a clone of Beasley. 
63,Marqise Lee JAC ,8,48,80,63.5,6.8,80.0,+17.0,It's hard to argue with the Lee supporters about his 2016 campaign which netted just 32 fewer yards and three touchdowns than his teammate Allen Robinson, and that's despite seeing 46 targets less than him. Lee was actually drafted before Robinson in 2014 but hasn't been able to stay healthy, missing 9 games in his first two years. There may be something here, and if you think there is, you'll need to move Allen Robinson down your list. 
64,J.J. Nelson ARI ,8,49,92,63.8,7.6,75.0,+11.0, 
65,John Ross CIN ,6,40,103,67.1,11.3,50.0,-15.0,Ross is one of the receivers who falls victim to the small, fast wide receiver prejudice. The crazy part is that he's much more than that, though he may not get to showcase his talents in year-one. The Bengals offensive line is a problem, but Ross will stretch the field for the rest of the passing game options. Expect him to have a few games that make you want more, but it's unlikely he's a weekly contributor in 2017.
66,Taylor Gabriel ATL ,5,50,79,64.7,6.4,56.0,-10.0,There was a lot of splash plays for Gabriel in 2016, but expecting that to continue may be a recipe for disaster. Matt Ryan's touchdown rate was north of 7 percent in 2016, which was almost double of what it's been in previous years. Gabriel saw 7 targets that were thrown 20 or more yards in the air, while the rest of the Falcons receivers saw 45 of those targets. Gabriel scored 3 touchdowns, which was equal to everyone else's combined. Regression is coming to a player who saw just under five targets per game with the Falcons. 
67,Allen Hurns JAC ,8,41,89,66.5,8.2,72.0,+5.0,When Hurns came onto the scene in 2014, everyone was surprised when he posted over 100 yards and two touchdowns in Week 1. He was wildly inconsistent that season, but really came on in 2015 when Bortles finished as the No. 4 quarterback. While Bortles declined, so did Hurns. Not just that, but Marqise Lee made a name for himself. In games with Lee on the field over his career, Hurns averaged 1.4 fewer targets per game. Keep in mind that the Jags will be throwing less in 2017 as well.
68,Anquan Boldin BUF ,6,46,120,76.5,18.4,79.0,+11.0, 
69,Malcolm Mitchell NE ,9,43,145,74.8,15.2,66.0,-3.0,The Patriots just have too many weapons to start Mitchell from week to week. He may have some big weeks here and there, but unless someone gets injured, he is hardly worth owning.
70,Will Fuller HOU ,7,50,115,75.8,16.3,74.0,+4.0,After what was a great start to his career, totaling nine receptions for 211 yards and a touchdown in his first two NFL games, Fuller was almost non-existent over the remainder of the season, totaling just 36 receptions for 426 yards and one touchdown. Tom Savage won't help and Deshaun Watson doesn't have a strong arm to get the ball downfield. Fuller is going to struggle without a quarterback who can throw the ball deep.
71,Mike Williams LAC ,9,46,124,77.8,16.8,63.0,-8.0,With the news coming out about a bulging disc in his back, it's hard to trust the rookie, even if he was the No. 7 overall pick. The Chargers don't need to rush it with him, as they have plenty of other options in the passing game. 
72,Devin Funchess CAR ,11,50,95,70.3,9.0,82.0,+10.0,There are a lot of people doubting Kelvin Benjamin this off-season, but they aren't thinking about what that'd mean for the rest of the offense, and in particular, Funchess. Not only did Benjamin struggle down the stretch, but both Ted Ginn and Corey Brown left via free agency, freeing up 148 targets in the offense. While most think rookies will make up for most of that, Funchess himself has caught nine touchdowns on just 121 career targets and has a healthy 15.7 yards per reception. 
73,Tavon Austin LAR ,8,46,93,69.3,8.9,77.0,+4.0,Tavon will always be a high upside streamer from week to week, but unless McVay uses him in a completely different way, he should go undrafted in most standard leagues. 
74,Nelson Agholor PHI ,10,46,160,81.4,21.4,71.0,-3.0,After the Eagles shipped Jordan Matthews away, it seems as though Agholor will get his crack at the starting slot position. Granted, he is dropping everything in site, but there is a route to WR4 type numbers should he win the job.
75,Cooper Kupp LAR ,8,51,110,77.2,12.8,62.0,-13.0,The wide receiver who Steve Smith said would've been the No. 1 on his board in this year's draft. Going to play with Jared Goff may be one of the best things, as he needs a receiver who can run the routes over the middle of the field and build his confidence. It'll be interesting to see if Robert Woods gets the nudge over him to start the season. 
76,Mohamed Sanu ATL ,5,52,91,70.5,8.0,64.0,-12.0,His first year in Atlanta was a mixed bag, and while he was injured throughout some of it, waiver addition Taylor Gabriel made an even bigger impact. Sanu totaled 10.7 or more fantasy points in three of his first eight games with the team, but failed to score more than 9.2 points the remainder of the season. Gabriel is in for some regression, so maybe Sanu winds up on the receiving end of that. 
77,Torrey Smith PHI ,10,45,98,76.4,9.2,97.0,+20.0,

80,Michael Floyd MIN ,9,57,155,91.5,17.9,98.0,+18.0, 
81,Chris Conley KC ,10,53,109,79.0,12.0,90.0,+9.0,Alex Smith has never supported two fantasy wide receivers, but Chris Conley is a special athletic specimen who could change that narrative with this year's opportunity. He is well worth a lottery ticket and should Maholmes take over, Conley could explode onto the scene.
82,Chris Hogan NE ,9,54,96,78.3,7.6,67.0,-15.0, 
83,Paul Richardson SEA ,6,56,118,82.9,11.6,94.0,+11.0, 
84,Curtis Samuel CAR ,11,57,102,77.9,9.3,78.0,-6.0,While Samuel isn't yet expected to see more touches than Devin Funchess, it is worth noting that he was one of the most electric receivers and runners in college and should he get a larger opportunity, he could be a breakout rookie.
85,Tyler Boyd CIN ,6,59,120,79.6,10.6,92.0,+7.0, 
86,Laquon Treadwell MIN ,9,59,104,81.8,10.3,88.0,+2.0,The Vikings have made it clear that they expect Treadwell to be their #3 wide receiver, which means we could see a breakout, but unless Diggs or Thielen ends up injured, he won't be startable even as a flex.
