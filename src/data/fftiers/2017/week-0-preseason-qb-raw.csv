1,Aaron Rodgers GB ,8,1,2,1.1,0.3,1.0,0.0,He's a machine, plain and simple. Year-over-year Rodgers builds his hall of fame resume, and it translates to fantasy, considering he's finished as the No. 1 or No. 2 quarterback in seven of nine seasons (was also No. 1 before getting hurt in 2013) since taking over for Brett Favre. There's so much uncertainty around this part of the rankings, he's simply a safer pick.
2,Tom Brady NE ,9,1,8,2.2,0.8,2.0,0.0,While everyone else tries to figure out who he'll will throw to and which running back will get the majority of the carries, just take Brady and enjoy your points.
3,Drew Brees NO ,5,1,4,2.9,0.5,3.0,0.0,Just a bit outside of the top-tier of quarterbacks, Brees is still a set-it-and-forget-it quarterback. Much have been made of his road splits, but he is simply â€˜less great' on the road. Over the last two years on the road he averages 297 passing yards, 1.73 touchdowns, and 0.93 interceptions, or 17.9 fantasy points per game. That average over 16 games would have been the No. 7 quarterback last year. Not so bad, eh?
4,Russell Wilson SEA ,6,2,10,5.4,1.5,6.0,+2.0,Despite playing on one leg for a majority of the season, Wilson still managed to finish as a QB1 in 2016. If you were to get into his game log, you'd see that he was a different quarterback over the second-half of the season, finishing as the No. 4 quarterback from Week 9 through Week 17.
5,Matt Ryan ATL ,5,2,18,6.1,2.4,4.0,-1.0,Some may say this is too low, but Ryan isn't going to repeat his 7.1 percent touchdown rate, as his previous career-high was 5.2 percent. His yards per attempt was also 1.8 yards more than his previous career-high. Regression is coming for Matty Ice.
6,Andrew Luck IND ,11,2,19,6.7,3.5,5.0,-1.0,The last of the quarterbacks you should consider in the top-40 players, Luck is a player who can throw for 5,000 yards and 40 touchdowns. Prior to hurting his shoulder, Luck threw for 4,761 yards and 40 touchdowns, so we weren't far off. His weapons are arguably as good as they've ever been.
7,Kirk Cousins WAS ,5,4,15,8.3,2.7,11.0,+4.0,Since 2014, here is the list of quarterbacks who've thrown for more yards per attempt than Kirk Cousins (min. 600 attempts): Ben Roethlisberger and Matt Ryan. That's it. While he did lose Desean Jackson and Pierre Garcon, they attempted to right that by acquiring Terrelle Pryor. He'll also get last year's first-round pick Josh Doctson on the field, attempting to take over Garcon's role in the offense. It may take time to get acclimated, but Cousins is a back-end QB1. 
8,Marcus Mariota TEN ,8,4,16,9.0,2.9,9.0,+1.0,It's hard not to take notice as to what the Titans have done this off-season, precisely in their attempts to get Mariota more weapons. Not only did they draft Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor, they also went out and signed Eric Decker to a one-year contract. If Mariota disappoints, it won't be because of the talent around him.
9,Jameis Winston TB ,11,4,18,9.6,2.8,12.0,+3.0,Everything that has happened this off-season for the Bucs, has happened because they want Winston to have all the tools to succeed. It would have been nice to see them build up the offensive line a bit, but really good wide receivers can help make up for that. He's finished inside the top 16 quarterbacks each of his first two seasons, and this is the season he takes the leap into the top 12.
10,Cam Newton CAR ,11,4,19,10.4,3.1,8.0,-2.0,He's now finished as the QB17 in two of his last three seasons, and the Panthers want to take away the thing that creates his fantasy points, running the ball. Not only did they extend Jonathan Stewart, but they drafted Christian McCaffrey with a top-eight pick, and took hybrid running back/wide receiver Curtis Samuel in the second-round. In the 11 games after his concussion last year, Newton ran the ball just 61 times for 212 yards and three touchdowns, a far cry from his 100-plus carry, 600-yard rushing seasons in the past.
11,Ben Roethlisberger PIT ,9,4,22,11.6,3.5,13.0,+2.0,When I initially did my rankings, Roethlisberger was ranked as my No. 12 quarterback, but something big has happened since that time. Martavis Bryant was reinstated. He's played 19 career games with Bryant, averaging 337 yards and 2.11 touchdowns in those games. You have to deal with his road struggles, but his home games will win you weeks.
12,Derek Carr OAK ,10,5,18,11.9,3.0,7.0,-5.0,As good as Carr looks at times, he's been very volatile as a fantasy option. Carr turned heads with his 35.8 point performance against the Buccaneers last year, but in his other 14 games, Carr was very mediocre. He totaled just 16.6 points per game in all other games, which would have ranked 17th among quarterbacks last year. His schedule is among the worst in football and they just brought in Marshawn Lynch to steal some touchdowns. 
13,Dak Prescott DAL ,6,6,18,12.7,2.9,10.0,-3.0,Was the No. 6 quarterback last year on a points per game basis if you were to remove Week 17 when he was pulled after one series. There were only four quarterbacks who were QB1's in 68.8 percent of their games last year: Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, Aaron Rodgers, and Prescott (that includes his Week 17 game). My biggest concern is his schedule.
14,Philip Rivers LAC ,9,5,18,13.2,2.9,14.0,0.0,A brutal start to his schedule will likely prevent Rivers from reaching the heights that most have set for him. He'll have to play the Broncos twice, Chiefs, Giants, Raiders, Patriots, and Jaguars in the first nine games. His numbers have fallen off after Week 8 in the three past seasons, so keep your expectations for him realistic.  
15,Matthew Stafford DET ,7,5,19,13.3,3.4,15.0,0.0,Stafford finished as the No. 7 quarterback in 2016, but his totals were nothing to write home about, especially over the final 10 games. After throwing three or more touchdowns in four of their first six games, Stafford didn't have a single game with more than two touchdowns the rest of the season. He turned into somewhat of a game manager, which is good for their team, but not so much for your fantasy team. He scored more than 17 fantasy points just twice after Week 6. 
16,Tyrod Taylor BUF ,6,7,21,15.1,2.9,16.0,0.0,Finished as the QB7 on a point per game basis in 2016, and was after finishing as the QB8 in 2015. He continues to be one of the most under-appreciated players in all of fantasy. The Bills went out and spent a high-2nd-round pick in order to snag wide receiver Zay Jones, giving him a legitimate threat opposite Sammy Watkins, who is now in a contract year.
17,Andy Dalton CIN ,6,9,22,16.3,2.6,18.0,+1.0,Most don't know that Dalton has finished as a top-12 fantasy quarterback in three of the last five years, including a No. 4 finish in 2013. He's got some issues on the offensive line, but he also has the best receiving options he's ever had, and it's really not all that close. 
18,Eli Manning NYG ,8,10,20,17.2,2.2,17.0,-1.0,The last time Manning had a season like the one he did in 2016, was 2013 when he threw for just 3,818 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 27 interceptions. What he did the following two seasons was near pro-bowl caliber, averaging just over 4,400 yards and 33 touchdowns. The additions of Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram should only help him get back to that area. If not, this may be the end for the two-time Super Bowl champion. 
19,Carson Palmer ARI ,8,14,25,19.3,2.0,20.0,+1.0,It's pretty obvious that Palmer's 2015 season was an outlier in what's been a mediocre career. Despite throwing 60 more passes in 2016, he finished with 438 fewer yards and nine fewer touchdowns. It didn't help that John Brown was injured for a majority of the season and that Michael Floyd turned bad. They added Chad Williams in the NFL Draft, but he's an extremely raw receiver. You should expect a slight increase on his 2016 totals, but don't expect him to return to 2015 form. 
20,Carson Wentz PHI ,10,15,25,19.7,1.9,19.0,-1.0,Wentz is a popular breakout candidate among the fantasy community, but nothing about his 2016 season suggests that, as he got worse as the season went on. After competing 67.4 percent of his passes for 7.5 yards per attempt with seven touchdowns and one interception in his first four NFL starts, Wentz trended downward. Over the next 12 games, he completed just 61 percent of his throws for 5.9 yards per attempt with nine touchdowns and 13 interceptions. The additions of Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith should help, but he needs to show us that he's capable before investing more. 
21,Blake Bortles JAC ,8,10,26,20.4,2.3,22.0,+1.0,Yes, he was horrid last season on film, but did you know he outscored Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston? Everyone is now calling his QB #5 performance from 2015 a fluke, but bare in mind, he played with an injured shoulder all of last year and we saw just how much that wrecked even Andrew Luck. Bortles is due for a bounceback season and has immense upside to go with a safe floor thanks to his underrated legs.
22,Joe Flacco BAL ,10,11,32,23.1,2.3,24.0,+2.0,Flacco threw an absurd 672 passes last season and added Danny Woodhead and Jeremy Maclin this off-season. He is a virtual lock to toss for another 4,000+ yards, and is a good bet to see a positive bump in TD% which should help him improve upon his rough QB #20 season from 2016.
23,Sam Bradford MIN ,9,20,32,23.9,2.1,26.0,+3.0,Bradford was extremely accurate last season and this is the first time in his career he'll have the same offensive coordinator in back to back seasons. His receiving core, offensive line and running game should all be improved as well, so don't be surprised when he improves upon his QB #22 performance from 2016.
24,Jay Cutler MIA ,11,18,33,24.2,3.1,25.0,+1.0, 
25,Alex Smith KC ,10,20,32,24.5,1.7,23.0,-2.0,Smith hasn't thrown double-digit interceptions since 2010, but that doesn't count for much. What does count, is that he has never thrown 520 times in any season, he stopped running and has nothing close to a #1 WR.
26,Brian Hoyer SF ,11,19,41,26.0,2.8,27.0,+1.0,Hoyer hasn't been bad when he plays, but he's got little in the way of help in this 49ers offense and isn't guaranteed the starting gig.
27,Deshaun Watson HOU ,7,22,52,28.9,4.1,21.0,-6.0,As it stands now, Savage should be the Week 1 starter. That doesn't change the fact that Watson is the most polished rookie QB and would be throwing to DeAndre Hopkins should he step into the role mid-season.
28,Trevor Siemian DEN ,5,20,35,28.8,2.6,,,Lynch is breathing down his neck and the schedule is a nightmare to begin the season, so don't expect much this season from the low-ceiling QB.
29,Mike Glennon CHI ,9,23,39,28.5,2.3,,,If Glennon can indeed hold of Trubisky for the starting role, he has some decent pieces to work with on offense. With that being said, his upside is limited as the team is built to run the ball.
30,Jared Goff LAR ,8,24,35,28.7,2.3,,,Goff was a nightmare last season as he was incapable of doing anything behind that abysmal line with no receivers to pass to. They made enough changes this off-season that we should get a glimpse of who Goff is, but it was so ugly that you shouldn't get your hops up.
31,Colin Kaepernick FA ,,21,60,38.8,7.5,,,

36,Mitch Trubisky CHI ,9,26,42,36.0,3.0,,, 
37,Josh McCown NYJ ,11,26,38,31.2,2.2,,,McCown should enter the season as the starting QB, but with Decker and Marshall now gone, there isn't much hope that he can produce as even a low-end QB2.
38,Cody Kessler CLE ,9,27,43,32.4,3.2,,,Kessler is a game manager in a miserable offense who's #1 receiver is Kenny Britt. Make of that what you will, but I don't consider him anywhere near a QB2.
